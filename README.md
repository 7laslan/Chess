 ## Chess project

This'll be the first project that I'll create on my own and isn't part of my school work.

I want to learn how to code games, and I've decided to start off with trying to create already existing games using Java.

My first project is to code a simple chess game (this won't be anything fancy, no fancy graphics etc. just pure code).

I'll try to create as much as I possibly can from my own head, but I'll be also taking references from this guide: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-chess-game/

## I don't claim anything as my own, this is just pure practice for me for the future :)
